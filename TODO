1) Short-term:

* Release of Registro.br renewal sync functions (both 4.x and 5.1+ styles)

* Release of EPP polling script

* Figure out how to keep created domain at pending state until sync or poll

* Preserve ticket number on the database, use the ticket number if
  nameserver change is requested before domain creation completion. Domain
delete before creation completion could be done by removing nameservers.

* Automated patching of whoisservers.php or product configurations

* More documentation on parameters and usage, including tips to avoid issues
  like using numbers in street names ("Av Doze de Outubro" instead of
  "Av 12 de Outubro";

* Replace WHOIS/isavail with EPP domain info

* Code most of the syntax check for .br restrictions
  (ftp://ftp.registro.br/pub/libepp-nicbr/pt-policy-restrictions-espec.txt)
  to avoid issues, like character limits, enconding and so forth

* Convert ISO 8859-1 back and forth at get/set contact, domain create

* Option to use EPP-Proxy

2) Long-term:

* Option to automate AGP(Add Grace Period) if invoice does not clear out 

* Create widget, possibly from EPP Reports files (production only)

* Integrate with DNSSHIM
