DETAILS

- WHMCS version 4.x or higher (sync requires version 5.1 or higher)

INSTALLATION

1 - Login as root or use sudo or su
2 - Run the install.sh with the following parameters:
install.sh <servername> <docroot> <whmcsdir> <whmcscrons>

If not specified, the default value of <servername> is the hostname of the server, the default <docroot> is "/var/www", default <whmcsdir> is "/var/www/whmcs" 
and default WHMCS croons directory is "/var/www/whmcs/crons". Note that WHMCS security recommendations are to move crons away from HTTP-accessible directories. 

2 - After running the script, the following should have occured:

a) The files Avail.php brdomaincheck.php and should be in the server's root directory 
b) The file must have whmcs whoisserver.php of entries. br modified with the content of listservers.txt, pointing to your domain.
c) ... whmcs/modules/registrars/registrobr/  should be created and contain the distribution files
d) The root crontab should contain entries similar to:

6 * * * * /usr/bin/php -q /home/parcelaf/public_html/whmcs/crons/registrobrpoll.php
50 */4 * * * /usr/bin/php -q /home/parcelaf/public_html/whmcs/crons/domainsync.php

This entry will be responsible for obtaining any return messages on transactions and registrations.

SETTING

1) In WHMCS's control panel top lime, click on "Setup".

2) Click then on "Products / Services" => "Domain Registrars"

3) Enable Registro.br module and then configure it.

4) Fill the blanks with your data authentication. Username is the number of EPP provider (ex: 001) and not the ID provider (eg ANF).
   For now, leaves the TestMode option enabled. The certificate for use of beta.registro.br comes as part of the distribution module.

5) CPF and CNPJ are the indications of which fields from the database of clients are being used to store this information. They may be the same field or different fields.

6) Filling TechC is optional; without it domains are created with registrant being the technical contact.

7) For the correct processing of the messages return ("Poll"), you need support departments in WHMCS and assign users to them. In the "Sender Username", use a Username that is on your list of administrators ('../Whmcs/admin/configadmins.php') as root, or sign one.
 
8) It's suggested, although not required, to keep the module log enabled in Utilities -> Log -> Log Module, even for production use, to facilitate the diagnosis of
problems reported by customers. By doing so, it won't be necessary to ask the customer to redo a transaction for an issue to be diagnosed.

For code quality tests, please see file UNITYTESTINGHOWTO.

 
 
ACTIVATION IN PRODUCTION

- Copy the  receveid file .pem  for an area outside of Apache's documents directory
- In the administration of WHMCS -> Setup -> General Settings -> Domain Registrars -> Registro.br, disable the option TESTMODE, change user and password information for the production and enter the directory where the certificate was copied and the pass-phrase certified
- Make a test recording without DNS records to verify that a ticket can be generated. Don't configure DNS for domain TO AVOID THE TRANSACTION !
